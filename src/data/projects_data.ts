For this year's competition, the arm has been significantly simplified in order to reduce weight without losing any of its strength or robustness from the first arm iteration. whole new rover for a new competition from scratch is a tremendous task - but TrickFire did it anyway!",

With an all-aluminum chassis Grimlock weighed in at just shy of 80 kilograms.",

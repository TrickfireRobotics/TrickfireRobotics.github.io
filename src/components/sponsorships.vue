                    TrickFire relies on generous donations to purchase the necessary materials and equipment to build the
                    rover and travel to competitions. Your donations will directly impact the development of our students.
                    In-kind sponsorships are also a tax-favored solution to help our team get much-needed resources and
                    tools to help construct the robot. In addition to donations, we seek industry mentors. Our team strives
                    for professional quality work. As such, working with your organizationâ€™s professionals provides
                    invaluable experience that helps us reach that goal while giving you a direct connection to candidate
                    employees.

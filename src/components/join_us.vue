                        TrickFire’s mission is to give students the
                        hands-on, applicable experience crucial to entering
                        the working world. Here, students can gain skills in
                        software, mechanical and electrical engineering, and
                        business skills such as budget management and
                        communications. All of these skills will prepare
                        students for their resumes, and they will be able to
                        talk about their work in TrickFire, while having fun
                        along the way! No previous robotic experience is
                        needed.

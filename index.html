                            TrickFire Robotics is a student-led robotics team focused on providing a 
                            unique educational experience through hands-on work on large scale projects. 
                            Since 2016 the team has traveled to the Kennedy Space Center to represent the 
                            University of Washington Bothell at the annual NASA Robotics Mining Competition.
                             A competition that pits fifty college teams to design and build a rover that can mine on the surface of the moon.

                            Throughout the year, the team develops a number of different skills as members research, design, and build the robot. 
                            Other members learn the skills of team management, financial responsibilities, and public relations.
                            But most importantly, everyone gains the skills of professionalism that prepares them for their future work.

                            The software team is responsible for making the robot function through autonomous or through teleoperated controls. 
                            The financial team is responsible for keeping the team logistically functional and securing funding. 
                            The outreach team is responsible for advertising TrickFire to the world through advertisements, social media, or through community participation.

              <p>
                Our mission is to develop ourselves by developing a rover for
                space, among our other projects.

                Key club values are communication, execution, and determination.

            <h3>About Us</h3>
            <p>
              TrickFire’s mission is to give us students hands-on, relevant
              experiences crucial to entering the working world. Here, students
              can gain skills in software, mechanical, and electrical
              engineering, business, and marketing. You can work on a robotic
              arm, a sponsorship packet, and a drone all in the same club if
              you’re willing to put in the time. All of these learning
              opportunities and experiences will improve our resumes, give us
              great talking points, and create fond memories!

            <h3>About Team</h3>
            <p>
              TrickFire is made up of smaller teams that all contribute their
              own disciplines to the final rover and provide members with
              different opportunities to flex their skills. Members can join
              multiple teams and each team works on several different projects
              in their own subteams, so there is always something new and
              interesting to be worked on. Interdisciplinarity is encouraged and
              supported.

                detection methods that can identify microbes in the soil. We aim

                rover system, we aim to be open-minded about untraditional life

                As the Mechanical Lead of TrickFire, I lead the drafting and
                design of static and dynamic rover systems. I encourage Design
                for Manufacturing (DFM) to a high standard. DFM is the most
                important lesson a hands-on project can offer. Mechanical
                Engineers must learn how to utilize standard and innovative
                manufacturing tools just as we learned to use our environment to
                shape the modern world. The Trickfire Mechanical Team is
                determined to make it to competition and will use iterative
                design cycles to achieve this.

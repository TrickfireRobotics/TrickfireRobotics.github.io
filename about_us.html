                    <p>
                        Trickfire is all about giving our members hands-on education that can only be experiencedworking on a large-scale project. 
                        For the last several years, this project has been the NASA Robotics Mining Competition, and annual event that pits 50 
                        college robotics teams around the nation to build the most efficient autonomous lunar mining rover. The team works
                        year-round to design, manufacture, and test the rover, just in time to travel to Kennedy Space Center, FL for the competition.

                        <br/>
                        Our team's mission can be narrowed down into three pillars:
                        <br/>
                        1. Techinical development by working on industry leading robotics
                        <br/>
                        2. Professional development by working with a large scale team.
                        <br/>
                        3. A strong community within the University of Washington Bothell.

                    <p>
                        TrickFire is all about giving our members hands-on
                        education that can only be experienced working on a
                        large-scale project. For the last several years,
                        this project has been the NASA Robotics Mining
                        Competition, an annual event that pits fifty college
                        robotics teams around the nation to build the most
                        efficient autonomous lunar mining rover. The team
                        works year-round to design, manufacture, and test
                        the rover, just in time to travel to Kennedy Space
                        Center, Florida for the competition.

                        Our team's mission can be narrowed down into three
                        pillars:
                        <br />
                        1. Technical development by working on industry
                        leading robotics
                        <br />
                        2. Professional development by working with a large

                        <br />

                        weight to under 60kg. The team succeeds in producing
                        an efficient rover by incorporating various light
                        weight composites with elegant design.

                        needing different voltage levels and power
                        distribution, the team works hard to ensure all of
                        them are efficiently integrated through circuit
                        design and power control. With their help the

                        control is seamless.

                        It is the job of this team to plan years in advance

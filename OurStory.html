          <h3>About Us</h3>
          <p>
            TrickFire’s mission is to give students the hands-on, applicable
            experience crucial to entering the working world. Here, students can
            gain skills in software, mechanical and electrical engineering, and
            business skills such as budget management and communications. All of
            these skills will prepare students for their resumes, and they will
            be able to talk about their work in TrickFire, while having fun
            along the way!

          <h3>About Team</h3>
          <p>
            TrickFire is made up of smaller teams that all contribute their own
            disciplines to the final rover and provide members with different
            opportunities to flex their skills. Members can join multiple teams
            and each team works on several different projects in their own
            subteams, so there is always something new and interesting to be
            worked on.

              As the software lead, I am responsible for leading the development
              of rover code that is well-documented, easy to expand, and that is
              robust through heavy cooperation with the rest of the software
              team. As one of the presidents, I work with Adan R. to direct
              TrickFire's overall direction.

              As the Biology Lead, I work with our Biology team to develop
              detection methods that can identify microbes in the soil. We aim
              to develop light, accurate and efficient systems that can detect
              life in multi ways from imaging to metabolism. Working with a
              rover system, we aim to be open-minded about untraditional life
              forms and always look beyond just Earth mophologies.

              As the Mechanical Lead of TrickFire, I lead the drafting and
              design of static and dynamic rover systems. I encourage Design for
              Manufacturing (DFM) to a high standard. DFM is the most important
              lesson a hands-on project can offer. Mechanical Engineers must
              learn how to utilize standard and innovative manufacturing tools
              just as we learned to use our environment to shape the modern
              world. The Trickfire Mechanical Team is determined to make it to
              competition and will use iterative design cycles to achieve this.

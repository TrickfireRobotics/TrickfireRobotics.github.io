          <h3>About Us</h3>
          <p>
            TrickFire’s mission is to give students the hands-on, applicable
            experience crucial to entering the working world. Here, students can
            gain skills in software, mechanical and electrical engineering, and
            business skills such as budget management and communications. All of
            these skills will prepare students for their resumes, and they will
            be able to talk about their work in TrickFire, while having fun
            along the way!

          <h3>About Team</h3>
          <p>
            TrickFire is made up of smaller teams that all contribute their own
            disciplines to the final rover and provide members with different
            opportunities to flex their skills. Members can join multiple teams
            and each team works on several different projects in their own
            subteams, so there is always something new and interesting to be
            worked on.

              As the Electrical Co-Lead for the Trickfire Robotics team, I'm
              driven to inspire, grow, and lead by example. There's always a lot
              to do, and I'm in love with every second of it.

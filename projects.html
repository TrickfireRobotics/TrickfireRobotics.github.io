                                The NASA Robotics Mining Compeitition is a competition
                                hosted by NASA, where fifty teams across the United States
                                compete to build the best rover that can mine under a
                                simulated surface of the moon. A rover starts at the home base,
                                navigates through obstacles, and then reaches a mining
                                zone where it has to break through a few layers. It then
                                digs out regolith (gravel) and transports it back to the
                                home base, where it deposits the regolith. The process
                                is repeated multiple times.

                                is a third of its predecessors size, while
                                being able to mine 20% deeper due to our redesign of the

                                Atlas is the second iteration of the excavator, dump, trunk, and tread design. 
                                Although the fundamental design is the same as Grimlockâ€™s, the team completely overhaled 
                                the rover by adding in a reinforced carbon fiber frame, sailcloth dumping bin, 
                                and redesigning the drivetrain suspension.
                                As a result, Atlas, with its light carbon fiber frame, now weighs in at 67 kilograms, 
                                a significant reduction to prior iterations.

                                obstacle that could be thrown at it. With an
